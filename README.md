# Irrational-behavour-and-Globalisation-Netlogo

This is an Agent-based model(ABM) which using modified evolutionary game theory and irrational behaviour.

The exsiting profile is also with some more thoughts on adding more features into the model, but will not influence the model.

The netlogo file on Github is kind of broken, if you found this is interesting, you can contact me via email: zyuanzi@outlook.com. Thank you for the reading!
